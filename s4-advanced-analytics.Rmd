## Session 4: Advanced analytics

### Adrien Ickowicz, Ben Raymond

##### with valuable contributions from many others...

## What are we going to talk about

- Statistical modelling
    - descriptive statistics vs inference
    - Is causality reachable ?
    - Inference via simulation vs Inference via statistical modelling
- Simulating matches
    - the <span class="pkg">volleysim</span> package
    - the <span class="pkg">bandit</span> package
- Statistical (inference-based) models
    - Use the example of the effect of player height on passing performance
    - the effect of serve speed on outcome? Serve error vs breakpoint ?

## Statistical modelling
#### descriptive statistics vs inference

From wiki:

A descriptive statistic (in the count noun sense) is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features from a collection of information, while descriptive statistics (in the mass noun sense) is the process of using and analysing those statistics.

Example of descriptive statistics:
* Number of serve errors per set
* Break-point rate per set

Example of inference:
* How do these two quantities relate to one another?

## Statistical modelling
#### Causality

## Statistical modelling
#### Causality and correlation

https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations

So what is the problem? 

- An increase in the number of people at the beach causes a higher number of ice cream sales
- An increase in the number of people at the beach causes a higher number of shark attacks
- Therefore, people need ice cream for comfort after a shark attack; or is it that sharks attack people after they ate ice cream because they taste better?

## Statistical modelling
#### Inference via simulation vs Inference via statistical modelling

When do we use either:
- When the world can be simplified without loss of (too much) information, we can simulate;
    - Example: Can we simplify a volleyball game if we only want to know who is going to win? Anyone has an opinion?
- When the world is too complex, and we have no clue or the process is convoluted, we may want to try something simpler at first;
    - Example: Are tall players better passers than short players?

In a nutshell, when you cannot narrow down the factors that influence the uncertainty to a handy few, forget about simulation.

## Simulating matches
#### the <span class="pkg">volleysim</span> package:

```{r list_function_vs, results='asis'}
library(volleysim)
list_fun_vs <- lsf.str("package:volleysim")
cat(paste('-', list_fun_vs), sep = '\n')
```


---

## Simulating matches
#### the <span class="pkg">volleysim</span> package:

A quick overview: https://untan.gl/r-package-simulating-volleyball.html

Our turn. Open `s4-example-volleysim`.

---

## Simulating matches

The bandit functions in the <span class="pkg">ovlytics</span> package

```{r list_function_ovl, results='asis'}
library(ovlytics)
list_fun_ovl <- lsf.str("package:ovlytics")
cat(paste('-', list_fun_ovl[c(14,11, 10, 8, 4)]), sep = '\n')
```

What is this? See https://untan.gl/setter-choice.html

Our turn. Open `s4-example-bandit`.

And if you dont want to code... https://apps.untan.gl/bandit/

## Statistical models
#### Player height and passing performance

Question: Does height influence the passing quality?

Open `s4-player-height-passing`.

---

## Statistical models
#### Serve agression, speed and outcome

Question 1 : Should we ban serving errors ?

Question 2 : Is there an optimal serve speed for which the expected break-point is maximum ?

Open `s4-serve-speed-example`.
