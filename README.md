# R workshop 2022

Structure: 5 x two-hour sessions, each with presentation of course material, and time during which participants can work on exercises or with their own data.

## Preparation

Participants are asked to install R, RStudio, Git, and some R packages in preparation for the workshop, if they do not already have these on their computer.

1. Download and install R

   https://cran.r-project.org/
