# R workshop 2022

Structure: 5 x two-hour sessions, each with presentation of course material, and time during which participants can work on exercises or with their own data.

## Preparation

Participants are asked to install R, RStudio, Git, and some R packages in preparation for the workshop, if they do not already have these on their computer.

1. Download and install R

   https://cran.r-project.org/

2. Download and install RStudio

   https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

3. Download and install Git

   https://git-scm.com/downloads (Accept all the default options when installing)

4. Start RStudio and install some packages. This will take a while to run:

   ```
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "remotes"))
   ```

   And finally:

   ```
   install.packages("datavolley", repos = c("https://openvolley.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
   ```


## Draft course sessions

1. Introductions and a general overview of R.

1. Focus on the `datavolley` package in R, reading your data in and working with it.

1. Different methods of conveying information (tables, graphs, court plots, video) and how to generate these in R. Heatmaps, video playlists, and more.

1. Advanced analytics to support decision making, match preparation, and similar. Examples of statistical models, simulating matches.

1. Other odds and ends: computer vision and video processing, a brief introduction to R Shiny apps.
